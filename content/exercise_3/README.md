# Data Minded Academy - Containerization with Docker
## Exercise 3 - Interact with containers

Now that we’ve warmed up it’s time to get inside a container while it’s running! In this exercise, 
you will have to use the `docker` CLI to interact with running containers.

We will use the `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu` Docker image. Once instantiated as a container,
this image will outputs logs into a file `text.log`. Go inside the container and use `tail -f /usr/src/app/text.log` to 
follow the logs. Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a “secret message”.

1. Run a container from the `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu` image (in detached mode). Set an environment variable `MY-SECRET` to a value of your choice.

2. Go inside the running container (using the right method) and
   *  read the value of the `MY-SECRET` environment variable
   *  use `tail -f ./text.log` to follow the logs. Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a “secret message”. What is the secret message? 

3. List all existing containers created so-far (running or stopped). Cleanup by removing all containers.
   * **Hint**: You can provide multiple ids to `docker container rm` to remove multiple containers
   * **Hint**: Chain `docker container rm` with a command listing the ids of all containers to remove all of them at once.
